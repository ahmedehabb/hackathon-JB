Welcome to the `hackathon-JB` project! This repository showcases an agent built using the [Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://github.com/google/adk-python).

**Our primary agent for this hackathon, which [you can briefly describe its purpose here, e.g., "converts feature descriptions into code skeletons"], is located in the `agents/feature-to-code/` directory.**

This project utilizes the ADK to accelerate the development process. While this README provides general guidance on setting up an ADK-based agent, specific instructions for our agent are within its dedicated folder.

## ‚ú® What is this Agent?

Our agent, found in the `agents/feature-to-code/` directory, is a functional starting point demonstrating [mention its core functionality or the problem it solves]. It leverages the ADK's capabilities and comes pre-packaged with core logic relevant to its use case. While functional, it might require further customization (e.g., adjusting specific responses or integrating with external systems) for broader applications. Instructions on how it can be customized are included within its directory.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run our agent:

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   **Install the ADK:** Ensure you have the Agent Development Kit installed and configured. Follow the [ADK Installation Guide](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/get-started/installation/).
    *   **Set Up Environment Variables:** Our agent example relies on a `.env` file for configuration (like API keys, Google Cloud project IDs, and location). This keeps secrets out of the code.
        *   You will need to create a `.env` file in the `agents/feature-to-code/` directory (usually by copying a provided `.env.example` if available there).
        *   Setting up these variables, especially obtaining Google Cloud credentials, requires careful steps. Refer to the **Environment Setup** section in the [ADK Installation Guide](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/get-started/installation/) for detailed instructions.
    *   **Google Cloud Project (Recommended):** While the agent might run locally with just an API key in some configurations, it may leverage Google Cloud services like Vertex AI and BigQuery. A configured Google Cloud project is highly recommended. See the [ADK Quickstart](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/get-started/quickstart/) for setup details.

2.  **Clone this repository:**
    You can clone this repository by:
    ```bash
    git clone [URL_OF_YOUR_HACKATHON_JB_REPO]
    cd hackathon-JB
    ```
    *(Note: If you've forked the adk-samples repository, you might already be in the correct directory structure. Adjust the `git clone` command if needed.)*

3.  **Prepare the Environment and Dependencies:**
    *   **From the root directory of this project (`hackathon-JB/`)**, activate the Python virtual environment. This is often managed by Poetry or a similar tool:
        ```bash
        # If using Poetry, it typically manages its own shell activation.
        # This command assumes a virtual environment `bin/activate` script exists at the root.
        # Adjust if your setup is different (e.g., `poetry shell`).
        source ./bin/activate
        ```
        *(Note: If you are using Poetry, you might prefer `poetry shell` in the root directory to activate the environment. The `source ./bin/activate` command assumes a standard venv structure often created by `python -m venv .venv` and then `.venv/bin/activate` would be sourced. Please adjust this command based on how your virtual environment is set up in the root of the project).*
    *   Navigate into our agent's specific directory:
        ```bash
        cd agents/feature-to-code
        ```
    *   **Inside the `agents/feature-to-code` directory**, install the agent's specific dependencies. This is typically done using Poetry:
        ```bash
        poetry install
        ```
        *(Refer to `agents/feature-to-code/README.md` for any additional or alternative dependency setup instructions).*

4.  **Run Our Agent:**
    *   Ensure you have completed step 3 (environment activated, navigated to agent directory, and dependencies installed).
    *   **Still inside the `agents/feature-to-code/` directory**, run the agent using the ADK web interface:
        ```bash
        adk web
        ```
    *   This should start a local web server, and you can typically access the agent by navigating to `http://localhost:8000` (or similar, check the `adk web` output) in your browser.
    *   For any other specific setup, running options, or troubleshooting, always refer to the `README.md` file within the `agents/feature-to-code/` directory.

**Notes:**
* This agent has been built and tested using [Google models](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/models) on Vertex AI. You can test this agent with other models as well. Please refer to [ADK Tutorials](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/models/) to use other models.

**Key Changes in "Getting Started":**

1.  **Renamed and Reordered Step 3 & 4:**
    *   "Navigate to Our Agent" and "Run Our Agent" have been combined and rephrased into:
        *   **3. Prepare the Environment and Dependencies:** This now includes activating the virtual environment from the root, navigating to the agent directory, and installing dependencies (`poetry install`) within the agent directory. I've added a note about `poetry shell` as an alternative and the typical location of `activate` scripts.
        *   **4. Run Our Agent:** This step now clearly states to be inside `agents/feature-to-code/` and then run `adk web`. It also mentions the typical localhost URL.

2.  **Clarity on Directories:** Emphasized *where* each command should be run (root vs. `agents/feature-to-code/`).
3.  **Dependency Installation:** Explicitly mentioned `poetry install` within the agent's directory as a common step.
4.  **Repository Structure:** Added `bin/activate` and `pyproject.toml` as examples in the structure diagram to align with these instructions.

Make sure to adjust the note about `source ./bin/activate` vs. `poetry shell` or the exact path to your activate script if your project's virtual environment setup is different. If Poetry is used consistently, `poetry shell` (from the root) followed by `cd agents/feature-to-code` and then `adk web` might be a more common Poetry workflow. The `source ./bin/activate` is more generic for venv.
