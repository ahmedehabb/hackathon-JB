Welcome to the `hackathon-JB` project! This repository showcases an agent built using the [Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://github.com/google/adk-python).

**Our primary agent for this hackathon, which [you can briefly describe its purpose here, e.g., "converts feature descriptions into code skeletons"], is located in the `agents/feature-to-code/` directory.**

This project utilizes the ADK to accelerate the development process. While this README provides general guidance on setting up an ADK-based agent, specific instructions for our agent are within its dedicated folder.

## âœ¨ What is this Agent?

Our agent, found in the `agents/feature-to-code/` directory, is a functional starting point demonstrating [mention its core functionality or the problem it solves]. It leverages the ADK's capabilities and comes pre-packaged with core logic relevant to its use case. While functional, it might require further customization (e.g., adjusting specific responses or integrating with external systems) for broader applications. Instructions on how it can be customized are included within its directory.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run our agent:

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   **Install the ADK:** Ensure you have the Agent Development Kit installed and configured. Follow the [ADK Installation Guide](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/get-started/installation/).
    *   **Set Up Environment Variables:** Our agent example relies on a `.env` file for configuration (like API keys, Google Cloud project IDs, and location). This keeps secrets out of the code.
        *   You will need to create a `.env` file in the `agents/feature-to-code/` directory (usually by copying a provided `.env.example` if available there).
        *   Setting up these variables, especially obtaining Google Cloud credentials, requires careful steps. Refer to the **Environment Setup** section in the [ADK Installation Guide](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/get-started/installation/) for detailed instructions.
    *   **Google Cloud Project (Recommended):** While the agent might run locally with just an API key in some configurations, it may leverage Google Cloud services like Vertex AI and BigQuery. A configured Google Cloud project is highly recommended. See the [ADK Quickstart](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/get-started/quickstart/) for setup details.

2.  **Clone this repository:**
    You can clone this repository by:
    ```bash
    git clone [URL_OF_YOUR_HACKATHON_JB_REPO]
    cd hackathon-JB
    ```
    *(Note: If you've forked the adk-samples repository, you might already be in the correct directory structure. Adjust the `git clone` command if needed.)*

3.  **Navigate to Our Agent:**
    *   Our agent is located in the `agents/feature-to-code/` directory.

4.  **Run Our Agent:**
    *   Navigate into the agent's specific directory:
        ```bash
        cd agents/feature-to-code
        ```
    *   Follow the instructions in *that agent's* `README.md` file (i.e., `agents/feature-to-code/README.md`) for specific setup (like installing dependencies via `poetry install`) and running the agent.

**Notes:**
* This agent has been built and tested using [Google models](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/models) on Vertex AI. You can test this agent with other models as well. Please refer to [ADK Tutorials](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/models/) to use other models.
